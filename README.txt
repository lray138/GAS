I was doing some programming in one of my systems and I realized the "fluent" approach 
of method chaining was for me the better approach.  

I'm embracing Types so that anything I work with will be wrapped in a type class.  

I periodically run into situations where I wish I had that deeper understanding of Monadic programming
and that is what this journey started out as.

There are also a handful of functional libraries I've studied over the years.  

While my goal isn't to unesessarily rewrite them, I think there is merit in "rolling your own" from 
a learning perspective.

This project started during a period when I was trying to "level up my skills" as a programmer.

I was trying to understand functional concepts, and was also exploring creating my own MVC framework
based on some coding lessons I had been exposed to.  

It's July 2024, and I'm coming back to revist this.  I want to have tests (using PEST) for
each function.

I'm also trying to determine what can to be removed since the initial package was geared towards
the framework.

I've used this (mostly personally) for a few years and feel like everything that needs to be there is there
from a "real world" standpoint.  (i.e. problems I've ran into that I needed to solve).

A great example of this, and expirimentation, would be the "Model" class where we wanted some level of "scaffolding", and also
expirimenting with attachign anonymous functions to array keys.  This was experimental and silly.
